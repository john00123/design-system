# Introduction

Our design system's primary goals are:

* **Design faster** thanks to standard guidelines and readymade UI components
* **Develop faster** thanks to well-defined styles and code components
* **Ship a better product** with a beautiful, consistent user experience

In short, we want to **reduce the number of design decisions we have to make every day** so we can focus on our user's problems and on building whatever exciting features are in the pipeline.

The styleguide is broken down into the following areas:

#### Getting started

Here you can find our design principles as well as guides on how to get started using Nutanix Design System. You can also find resources to download and templates to accelerate your process from concept to high fidelity designs.

#### Primitives

This refers to the core patterns, the visual language for Nutanix's product portfolio. This includes color styles, typography and other visual elements that make our suite of products stand-out.

#### **Guides**

Set of best practices to help you make more responsible decisions when creating new experiences.
